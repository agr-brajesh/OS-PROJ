# Interactive Session Protector

An Operating Systems daemon designed to protect latency-sensitive interactive sessions (such as video calls, online classes, telemedicine, or live interviews) from resource starvation caused by heavy concurrent background workloads (compilation, compression, batch direct-I/O, CPU stress).

## Quick Start & 10-Step Demo Workflow

To run the complete 10-step demonstration workflow:

```bash
# Run the demo script (auto-detects real cgroups if root, or dry-run simulation)
./scripts/demo.sh
```

### Demonstration Steps Shown:
1. **Protector Startup**: Daemon acquires `/tmp/isp_demo.pid`, sweeps stale cgroups, and initializes `protector.slice`.
2. **Background Workloads Starting**: High-contention background CPU worker is spawned.
3. **Fake Call Starting**: `fake_call` begins 30 FPS stream holding `/dev/video10`.
4. **Session Detection**: Procfs scan detects active video descriptor; state machine transitions to `ACTIVE`.
5. **Classification**: Tree walking classifies `fake_call` as `PROTECTED`, worker as `BACKGROUND`, shell as `NORMAL`.
6. **Cgroup Resource Shaping**: Background `cpu.weight` throttled to `20` + `IDLE` IO priority; `fake_call` boosted to `800`.
7. **Frame Statistics**: `fake_call` logs 150 frames with 0 deadline misses (< 40ms deadline).
8. **Session Termination**: Video descriptor closes; state machine enters `IN_HYSTERESIS`.
9. **Hysteresis Period**: 4-second grace countdown ensures protection remains active against intermittent reconnects.
10. **Restoration of Normal Resource Allocation**: Baseline weights (100) restored, processes returned to original cgroups, daemon shuts down with zero lingering state.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### 1. cgroup v2 Unified Hierarchy & Permissions
- **Symptom**: `Failed to initialize cgroup hierarchy` or permission denied writing to `/sys/fs/cgroup`.
- **Cause**: Linux requires root privileges (or delegated cgroup permissions) to create sub-slices and write `cpu.weight` / `cgroup.subtree_control`.
- **Remedy**:
  - For full active enforcement: Run with `sudo ./build/protector --real`
  - For unprivileged environments: Use `--dry-run` (the safe default). In dry-run mode, the daemon executes all detection, classification, state machine transitions, and logs every cgroup write without modifying root system files.

### 2. Missing Webcam Device (`/dev/video10`)
- **Symptom**: `Failed to open webcam device /dev/video10`.
- **Cause**: No physical webcam is attached or `v4l2loopback` is not loaded in WSL2.
- **Remedy**:
  - Load the loopback kernel module: `sudo modprobe v4l2loopback video_nr=10 card_label="VirtualWebcam"`
  - Or use a dummy test file: `touch /tmp/dummy_video && chmod 0666 /tmp/dummy_video` and set `video_device = /tmp/dummy_video` in `config/protector.conf`. The demo script ([`scripts/demo.sh`](scripts/demo.sh)) and experiment runner ([`scripts/run_experiments.py`](scripts/run_experiments.py)) automate this fallback transparently.

### 3. ThreadSanitizer: `FATAL: unexpected memory mapping`
- **Symptom**: When running `./build_tsan/unit_tests`, TSan outputs `FATAL: ThreadSanitizer: unexpected memory mapping 0x5f...`.
- **Cause**: Recent Linux kernels and Ubuntu 24.04 glibc employ Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) with high entropy (32-bit/28-bit VMA randomization), placing PIE binaries outside TSan's fixed shadow memory table.
- **Remedy**:
  - Run the TSan binary with ASLR disabled: `setarch x86_64 -R ./build_tsan/unit_tests`
  - Or temporarily adjust the system entropy: `sudo sysctl vm.mmap_rnd_bits=28`

### 4. Stale Cgroups After Daemon Crash or SIGKILL
- **Symptom**: Cgroup hierarchy cannot be removed or error `Device or resource busy` on `rmdir`.
- **Cause**: The previous daemon was abruptly terminated (`kill -9`) while processes were inside `protector.slice/background` or `protector.slice/protected`. In Linux cgroups v2, directories cannot be deleted if PIDs remain inside them.
- **Remedy**:
  - The protector daemon implements automatic **Stale Cgroup Cleanup** (`cleanup_stale_hierarchy()`) upon startup. It reads all `/sys/fs/cgroup/protector.slice/*/cgroup.procs`, writes each stranded PID back to `/sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.procs`, and wipes the slice.
  - Manual evacuation command if needed:
    ```bash
    for p in $(cat /sys/fs/cgroup/protector.slice/* /cgroup.procs 2>/dev/null); do
        echo "$p" | sudo tee /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.procs >/dev/null
    done
    sudo rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/protector.slice/* 2>/dev/null || true
    sudo rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/protector.slice 2>/dev/null || true
    ```

### 5. PID Reuse Detection
- **Symptom**: Concern that a dead process PID might be reassigned by the kernel to a new unrelated process, causing erroneous throttling.
- **Resolution**: Both `ProcTable` and `CgroupManager` record the process `start_time` (jiffies since system boot parsed from `/proc/<pid>/stat` field 22). When a PID is refreshed or restored, the current start time is compared against the recorded start time. If the start time differs, the entry is invalidated, preventing any misdirected cgroup operations.

### 6. Pidfile Lock Contention (`/tmp/protector.pid`)
- **Symptom**: `Another instance of protector daemon is already running (locked /tmp/protector.pid)`.
- **Cause**: An active daemon is already holding the `flock` lock, or an orphaned process is still running.
- **Remedy**:
  - Verify if an instance is running: `ps aux | grep protector`
  - Stop the running instance gracefully: `kill -15 $(cat /tmp/protector.pid)`
  - If the previous instance crashed, `flock` locks are automatically released by the Linux kernel upon process death. A new daemon will seamlessly acquire the file and overwrite the PID.
